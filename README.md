# Word Inventor, the Sequel

#### Description

A modified version of my original [Word Inventor](https://github.com/iconsumeplutonium/word-inventor). It works almost exactly the same as the original, except it uses syllables instead. 

In the original program, any word longer than 7 letters would be an unpronouncable mess of consonants. With the new program, however, there were significant improvements to words between 8 and 14 letters in length. Based on my own anecdotal evidence:

   * 2 syllables (~5 letters): words are about the same
   * 3 syllables (~8 letters): WI2 is significantly less likely to generate unpronoucable words. By comparison, pronouncable words from WI1 are rare at this length.
   * 4 syllables (~11 letters): WI2 will still have mostly pronounceceable words, while WI1 words are entirely garbage.
   * 5 syllables (~14 letters): Only a few WI2 words will be pronounceable.
   * 6 syllables and up: Nothing is pronounceable across either program.
